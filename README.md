# Universal-Remote
The goal of this project is to build an universal remote controller for multiple different devices, only devices that use NEC Infrared(IR) Protcol are supported. The project is based on IRLib2, more information can be found on https://github.com/cyborg5/IRLib2/tree/39168cf62fbeba02a49755d7f0ac3173e620c0e5/IRLib2.

# Requirements
## Hardware
PIC16F15344
PICkit 3
IR diode
Switches
Printed Circuit Board (PCB)

## Software
MPLAB X IDE 6.20
KiCad 8.0

# Sections
The files of this project can be separated into two types: the software code that goes into the C code programmed into the PIC microcontroller, and files that is used to print PCB.
